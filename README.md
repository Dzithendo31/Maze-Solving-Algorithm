# Maze-Solving-Algorithm
In this repo, i'll be doing a research on using some of the algorithms to solve a Maze fast, this was inspired by the spped that i have when it comes to solving a maze.
This is a build up to one of my best which is the Soduku Solver.


1 idea
my first idea is not gonna work, or it illegible to failure, Recently worked on a C++ program(availible upon request) that extract componets given a threshold from an image, 
- So the idea would be the program will extract the paths as componets
- but it would't work as all paths will just become one white componet
- but i though of sperating them----which would close 

2 Idea 2
- proper in depth image 
- what i want to do is draw a line in the correct path
start will a simple image

using java create a class clalled sqaure that will be storing Group of pizels
- so each square of the image will have pixels
- on the path will be white
- those that include the image would be containing black pixels

--it gonna move with the neighbors
- then have all the paths 

SQAURE
bool visit = false
int[][] 2D = {{},{}}
bool hasB = True, defualt os true

methods
checkBlackNode(){
  will set hasB to true or false
}

Use sort of a data structure 
- each node will have to know the Three neighbors 
- can use floodfill - NOpe

- but mmmmmmmmmhh
