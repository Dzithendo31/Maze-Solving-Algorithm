# Maze-Solving-Algorithm
In this repo, i'll be doing a research on using some of the algorithms to solve a Maze fast, this was inspired by the spped that i have when it comes to solving a maze.
This is a build up to one of my best which is the Soduku Solver.


1 idea
my first idea is not gonna work, or it illegible to failure, Recently worked on a C++ program(availible upon request) that extract componets given a threshold from an image, 
- So the idea would be the program will extract the paths as componets
- but it would't work as all paths will just become one white componet
- but i though of sperating them----which would close 

2 Idea 2
- proper in depth image 
- what i want to do is draw a line in the correct path
start will a simple image
